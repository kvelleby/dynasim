# DynaSim

Dynamic simulation of regression models

DynaSim is a project written in Python 2.7 where the goal is to make a user-friendly interface for simulating spatially dependent and dynamic panel-data regression models. It will support all GLM models as well as hierarchical versions and multinomial models. It will also be possible to simulate an arbitrary number of models at each time-point in sequence.

Please look at the wiki for an example of the use.
